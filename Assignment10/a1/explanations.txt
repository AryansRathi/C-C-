Q10.1(a)
When using namespace std is commented out the complier tells the string was not declared in the scope and cout also not declared in the scope.
using namespace std is used for differentitating similar functions, classes, varaibles.
So Using namespace, we can define the context in which names are defined. In essence, a namespace defines a scope.
(b)
When Critter:: was removed the complier gave the error like the name,hunger is not in the scope and to rename them.
So when Critter:: is removed the members are global and have have to be named differently.
